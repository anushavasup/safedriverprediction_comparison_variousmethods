Dataset Description:
	Dataset Name:  Insurance.csv(train.csv from kaggle safedriver prediction competition)

The dataset is about the largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, Porto Seguro in Brazil. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. It contains the data, where each row corresponds to a policy holder, and the target columns signifies that a claim was filed.
I am to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.

	Columns and Rows: 595k rows and 59 columns
Problem Statement:
	The aim of the study is to predict the probability whether the driver will make an insurance claim with the purpose of providing the fairer insurance cost on the basis of individual driving habits. I will be predicting whether a claim will be filed (target = 1) or not (target = 0). The dataset comes under binary classification and dataset being imbalanced is subjected to balanced condition by applying various features. So I am to set up models according to the dataset and predict whether the drivers will initiate an insurance claim in the next year.
